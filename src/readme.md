- `parse_xml/` — Older stand-alone code that parses XMLs using multiprocessing. I don't use this code anymore——most of it went into notebooks/Preprocess_corpus.ipynb——but preprocessing parts of it could be useful later on.

- `set_globals.py` — Sets global variables to be used in multiple notebooks, generates `data/globals.p`.

- `bash_practice/` — Practice scripts to understand how to use SLURM and bash. 

- `sporc/` — All the files that I used to train and evaluate doc2vec and LDA on RIT's supercomputer, SPORC, minus the corpus.
